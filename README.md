 Our case study involves Twitter users' general reaction to the FTX cryptocurrency exchange collapse that took place over a 10-day period in November 2022. The data at hand are users tweets that we scraped from September 1st, 2022 to December 31st, 2023. Our research mainly consists of utilizing topic modeling techniques to identify aspects-frames for the Twitter discussions, and dictionary-based sentiment analysis to describe the opinion/attitude that the tweets express. We also extract data for the price trend of Bitcoin and Ethereum to study the effect of the crypto market on the sentiment of Twitter users discussing the matter.
